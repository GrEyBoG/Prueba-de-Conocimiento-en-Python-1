At the bottom you will find two buttons, the one on the left called 'Problem 1' will show you the solution of the first problem,
where six hundred different numbers will appear every minute, and the program will tell you how many numbers are odd, even, prime,
which was the first and last, and which was the highest and lowest number that was generated,
and you can also see specifically which is odd, even, prime, highest, lowest, first and last.

The last one, called 'Problem 2', will show you the solution of the second problem,
where you will be able to add, modify, delete and filter the users created by you.

The program was designed and laid out from scratch in Adobe XD,
using an eye-pleasing dark color palette with a minimalist design to give it a more modern look.

The program was programmed in Python, using the Tkinter library and the Sqlite3 database manager
to ensure that the user does not have to install third party programs to view the final product.
